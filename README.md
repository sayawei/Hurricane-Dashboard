# Hurricane Dashboard
## Predicting hurricane intensity and trajectories using machine learning and satellite data

This project focuses on predicting hurricane intensity and trajectories using advanced machine learning techniques and satellite data. The developed system incorporates a client-facing dashboard for visualization and analysis, supported by a MS SQL database for data storage and management. The project aims to provide actionable insights for disaster preparedness and mitigation, with significant applications in both research and industry contexts.
